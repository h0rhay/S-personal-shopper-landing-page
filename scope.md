# S - Sales Assistant / Personal Shopper landing page
## 'Good enough' scope (later features, like stock integration, to be added)

#### Description:
Build a web page for one member of our clienteling team. It should showcase them and their favorite products. 

#### Problem:
Clienteling offers our sales assistants the ability to drastically increase their sales and earn commission on these sales. But today they have no public profile. Some use their private social media accounts to extend their reach, but this is inconsistent. 

#### Hypothesis:
By giving our sales assistants their own web page on Selfridges.com we can explore whether a public profile will increase the sales assistant's reach and increase their sales	(helping them to earn more commission)

#### KPIs:
- Visits to sales assistant page 
- Clicks on product
- How many sales did the page generate? 
- Does it generate organic traffic?
