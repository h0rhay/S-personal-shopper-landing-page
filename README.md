- CI/CD deployment via Github actions
- AWS S3 deployment
- Testing with Jest and React testing library

### Instructions
- Clone the repo
- CD into repo folder
- Run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies
- Run `yarn start` or `npm start` to start the local development server
- Project will start on port 8000, this will 404, this is deliberate, as a personal shopper directory landing page was out of scope.
- Therefore please navigate to `8000/arron-dickinson` to see the first shopper page, and go from there.
- Please check the project on a mobile device or simulator to see a nice small screen view, with mobile specific swipeable product carousels.
